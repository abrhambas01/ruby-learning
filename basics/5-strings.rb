The main diï¬€erence is that double-quoted String literals
support string interpolations and the full set of escape sequences.
For instance, they can include arbitrary Ruby expressions via interpolation:
=end

puts 'Single line quoted strings don\'t support interpolation for example'
puts 'Today\'s time is #{Time.now}'
puts "Compared toToday\'s time is #{Time.now}"
puts "Today\'s time is #{Time.now}"

=begin
Double quoted quotes also support the entire set of escape sequences like : \n or \t
=end
puts 'Hello\nWorld'
puts "Hello\nWorld"

s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "World"
